# Goer AI Agent Coordination

This file is the shared coordination log for agents working in this repository.
Update it whenever you start, change, validate, or finish work.

## Collaboration rules

- Before editing, add an entry under **Active work** with your name, date, files,
  goal, and status.
- Do not edit files listed as actively owned by another agent without first
  coordinating in this file.
- Keep changes focused and record tests, blockers, and handoff details.
- Move completed entries to **Recent work** instead of deleting the history.
- Refresh the active entry before ending your task so another agent can continue.
- **Strict commit rule:** every individual code change, function, or documentation
  change must be committed immediately in its own focused commit. Never batch
  unrelated changes or thousands of changes into one commit.
